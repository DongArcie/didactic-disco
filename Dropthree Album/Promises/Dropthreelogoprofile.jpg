    <h2>Chorus</h2>
<p><blockquote>Cause Baby you broke my hearts
    <br>When I see you with someone around
    <br>Cause lately you said to me 
    <br>That I am the one that you'll be
</blockquote></p>
    <h2>Verse 1</h2>
    <p><blockquote>Saw you holding with someone else so inlove 
        <br>That moment I realize this is goodbye
        <br>The broken promises things that once you said 
        <br>You've said to me that I always be
    </blockquote></p>
    <h2>Verse 2</h2>
    <p><blockquote>I know I've felt this way before and it's nothing new
        <br>Cause in my dreams it's always you I wanna be
        <br>But it's too late now you've found someone
        <br>He must be a better lover than I
        <br>He must be a better lover than I

    </blockquote></p>
    <h2>Chorus</h2>
    <p><blockquote>Cause Baby you broke my hearts

    </blockquote></p>
    <h2>Bridge</h2>
    <p><blockquote>
        On and on I'm still waiting here
       <br> Time and time it's you I wanna hear
       <br> This time I pray for you 
        <br>This time I'll sing the words you've said

    </blockquote></p>
    <h2>Chorus (Clean)</h2>

    </blockquote></p>
    <h2>Chorus Outro</h2>
