    <h1>Now Showing by Dropthree</h1>
    <h2>Written and Composed by Roger Calingacion</h2>
    <h2>Verse 1</h2>
    <p><blockquote>
        Take my hand we're going downtown
        <br>Walk for miles under the city lights
        <br>And for awhile I asked her and smiled
        <br>Where she wants to go and have a good time
    </blockquote></p>
    <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
    <p><blockquote>Can I take you to the movies?
        <br>Can I take you to the movies?
        <br>She don't want to and It's alright
        <br>She just want to dance under the moonlight...Go!
    </blockquote></p>
    <h2>Verse 2</h2>
    <p><blockquote>As the night was fading slow
        <br>We talked about life and love to know
        <br>These million questions within our hearts 
        <br>Where? where? to go?
    </blockquote></p>
    <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
    <p><blockquote>Can I take you to the movies?
        <br>Can I take you to the movies? tonight
        <br>Can I take you to the movies?
        <br>Can I take you to the movies? tonight..my Darling
    </blockquote></p>
    <h2>Chorus</h2>
    <p><blockquote>Cause in the movies!
        <br>Where love last forver
    <br> Cause in the movies
    <br>Where love stays together
    <br>Cause in the movies
    <br>Where love last forever
    <br>Cause in the movies
    <br>Where love last foreever
    <br>Together,forever,forever and the never
